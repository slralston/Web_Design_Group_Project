Mars

Mars is the latest artwork by UK artist Luke Jerram.

Location: Nun's Island Distillery, H91 YA48

Runs Daily: Noon to 8pm

Measuring seven metres in diameter, the artwork features 120dpi detailed NASA imagery of the Martian surface. At an approximate scale of 1:1million, each centimetre of the internally lit spherical sculpture represents 10 kilometres of the surface of Mars.

The artwork allows us to view Mars from the air, as though we are a satellite mapping and studying the surface in perfect detail. Every valley, crater, volcano and mountain are laid bare for us to inspect. The artwork transports us to this desert wasteland, to imagine what it’s like to set foot on this incredible planet.

The installation is a fusion of Mars imagery, light and surround sound composition created by BAFTA and Ivor Novello award winning composer Dan Jones.

Co–commissioned by Kunsthal KAdE, Netherlands; UK Space Agency; Science and Technology Facilities Council, UK and UK Association for Science and Discovery Centres. With supporting partner University of Bristol.
