A luminarium is a sculpture people can enter to be moved to a sense of wonder at the beauty of light and colour.

From the Guggenheim in Spain to the Sydney Opera House in Australia, the monumental and interactive walk–in sculptures of Architects of Air, designed by Alan Parkinson, have astounded audiences across the globe.

The luminarium offers a dazzling maze of winding paths, soaring domes and scintillating light, creating a sense of wonder and enchantment for all ages.

Visitors are transported and immersed into an amazing world for a unique sensory experience. Enter and be amazed.
