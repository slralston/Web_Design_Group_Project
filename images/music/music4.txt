Junior Brother

An idiosyncratic, challenging and richly lyrical singer–songwriter, Junior Brother is the pseudonym of Co. Kerry, Ireland singer Ronan Kealy.

Following his acclaimed debut album Pull The Right Rope, which was a Choice Music Prize nominee for Irish Album of the Year, he has whipped up a dedicated following thanks to unmissable live shows, and music both excitingly forward–looking and anciently evocative.
