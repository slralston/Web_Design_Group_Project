Malaki

A wordsmith at the forefront of his craft, Malaki, whose name means messenger, is one of Ireland’s most prolific and fast–rising rappers.

Bursting onto the scene in January 2019 with the powerful spoken–word epic Call Us By Our Names, the young Dubliner has been carving out his place in Irish hip–hop ever since.
