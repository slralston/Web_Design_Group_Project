Mary Coughlan

This is a taster of Mary Coughlanâ€™s most ambitious project to date; to create and reimagine a piece of music written by Leiber & Stoller in 1969 for Peggy Lee called Mirrors. The album explored themes of murder, madness, despair, longing and the rise of Fascism in the USA in 1939.

On this album, Coughlan worked with musicians and visual artists to create an immersive multimedia experience. This is the first opportunity to see this work in progress before its premiere next year.
