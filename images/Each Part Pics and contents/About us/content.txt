Welcome to the Galway International Art Festival!

Our festival is a celebration of creativity, culture, and community. Each year, we bring together artists from around the world to showcase their work in the heart of Galway city center. From painting and sculpture to music and dance, our festival has something for everyone.

Next summer, from July 17-30, 2023, we'll be hosting our annual festival. Over the years, we've grown from a small local event to an internationally recognized destination for art lovers and enthusiasts. We're proud to have welcomed thousands of visitors to Galway, and we're excited to continue sharing our love of the arts with even more people in the years to come.

Whether you're a longtime fan of the festival or a first-time visitor, we invite you to join us for a truly unforgettable experience. Check out our schedule of events, meet our talented artists, and immerse yourself in the vibrant world of the Galway International Art Festival.
